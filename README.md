# Bird House

## Description
Bird House is a simple application that allows a user to search for a bird of their choice in order to receive a few fun facts about the bird as well as a downloadable recording of what the bird sounds like.

## Features

For a given bird species, this application provides fun facts and a downloadable recording of the bird's sound via the Xeno-Canto API, as well as an image of the bird itself via the Pexels API.

## Reflection

This project allowed us to familiarize ourselves with linking multiple outside APIs as well as utilizing another CSS framework, Bulma. Furthermore, this exprience provided great exposure to the benefits and challenges of working together as a team within a singular GitHub repository.

## Resources Used

jQuery, Bulma, Xeno-Canto API (https://xeno-canto.org/explore/api), Pexels API (https://www.pexels.com/api)
